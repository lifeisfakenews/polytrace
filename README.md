# PolyTrace
PolyTrace is a in depth logging bot for Discord with super easy setup

This repo is based off an Autocode app ([logisfakenews](https://autocode.com/app/lifn/logisfakenews)), the original standard lib code remains in the [lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps](https://github.com/lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps)

There are plans for a TypeScript rewrite.
Please expect this around July - August 2024
